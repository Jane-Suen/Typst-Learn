= Introduction
In this report, we will explore the various factors that influence _fluid dynamics_ in glaciers and how they contribute to the formation and behavior of these natural structures. 

+ The climate
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation
+ The topography
+ The geology

Glaciers as the one shown in @glaciers will cease to exist if we don't take action soon!

= Methods
We follow the glacier melting models established in @glacier-melt.

The equation $Q = rho A v +C$ defines the glacier flow rate.

The flow rate of a glacier is defined by the following equation:
$ Q = rho A v + C $

The flow rate of a glacier is given by the following equation:
$ Q = rho A v + "time offset" $

Total displaced soil by glacier flow:
$ 7.32 beta + sum_(i=0)^nabla Q_i / 2 $

Total displaced soil by glacier flow:
$ 7.32 beta + sum_(i=0)^nabla (Q_i (a_i - epsilon)) / 2 $

$ v := vec(x_1, x_2, x_3) $
